My projects in Udacity Artificial Intelligence & Specializations Nanodegree 
-----

6 months - Cohort started in January

This repository contains my completed project in the Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree. The projects are:


* Sudoku  : An artificial intelligence that plays Sudoku using Constratrain Satisfaction Algorithms.

* Advance Game Playing : An AI that solves an Isolation game using Minimax and Alphabeta algorithms written in python.

* Planning : Path planning using BFS, DFS, Uniform Cost, and different heuristics to find the shortest path of a goal specified using PDDL language.

* Sign Language Reconizer : Detect words in sign language videos. Hidden Markov Model solution written in python and using hmmlearn python library.

* Dog Breed Recognition: Using Convolutional Neural Networks and transfer learning from pre-trained models. Written in Python and using Keras as DL framework.

* RNN : Detecting stock prices and generating english text from Sherlock Holmes scripts. This projects is written 
in Keras.

* Amazon Alexa - Voice User Interfaces : Amazon Alexa uses implementation project. 

* Capstone project - Voice User Interfaces : Extraing features from audio and detecting the words using Recurrent Neural Networks in python and Keras.
